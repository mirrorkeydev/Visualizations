# _Are You The One?_ Season 1 Simulation

## Run Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

## Export to HTML

Use Jupyter Notebook's built-in export tool. If you'd like to use the palenight theme (as seen [here](https://mirrorkey.dev/Visualizations/public/areyoutheone.html)), checkout my [`custom.css`](https://gist.github.com/mirrorkeydev/5c9a996f8926fd8c6c7836825e71c6eb) config.
